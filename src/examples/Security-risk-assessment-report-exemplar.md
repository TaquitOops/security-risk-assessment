# Security Risk Assessment Report – Exemplar 

## Part 1: Select up to three hardening tools and methods to implement

Three hardening tools the organization can use to address the vulnerabilities found include:

1. **Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  
   MFA requires users to verify their identity in more than one way before accessing an application. Methods include fingerprint scans, ID cards, PINs, and passwords.

2. **Setting and Enforcing Strong Password Policies**  
   Password policies can include rules for length, acceptable characters, and discourage password sharing. Policies may also include account lockout after multiple failed login attempts.

3. **Performing Firewall Maintenance Regularly**  
   Firewall maintenance involves checking and updating security configurations to stay ahead of threats. Rules should reflect current standards for allowed and denied traffic.

## Part 2: Explain Your Recommendation(s)

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  
Enforcing MFA adds a layer of security beyond passwords. It reduces the chance of brute force or credential-based attacks. MFA also discourages password sharing, as the second factor is typically device- or identity-specific.

**Password Policies**  
Creating and enforcing strong password policies makes it harder for attackers to access the network. Measures like account suspension after failed logins, password complexity requirements, and disallowing reuse help prevent brute force attacks.

**Firewall Maintenance**  
Firewall rules should be reviewed regularly and updated after any security event. Suspicious traffic sources should be blocked. This helps protect against DoS and DDoS attacks and ensures only authorized traffic enters the network.
